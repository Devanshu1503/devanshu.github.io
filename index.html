          <h2>Toxicity in Valorant getting out of hand?</h2>
          <p class="mins">20 mins</p>
          <p class="description">
            As a person who has been gaming since his childhood, I believe the dynamics of how people treat each other
          in an online video game has drastically changed for the worse. In my blog post, I will be explaining the
        toxicity in one of the most popular online games in 2021. I want to increase awareness on this topic. That's why I am sharing this
      <a href="https://medium.com/@devanshu_2605/toxicity-in-valorant-getting-out-of-hand-ebb077009eda"target="_blank">Toxicity in Valorant getting out of hand?</a>
    which contains my best advice on tackling this situation.</p>

          <h2>Impacts of Grubhub on the students of Virginia Tech</h2>
          <p class="description">
          Taking in all the dining halls at Virginia Tech into account, how has introducing a digital media platform such as Grubhub affected the students
          living both off-campus and on-campus.  Moreover, how do dining dollars and meal plans effect the students who purchase it? My team and I wanted to inform everyone
          on this matter. That is why I am sharing this <a href="https://soundcloud.com/samantha-lynn-307260408/podcast-project-writing-in-digital-media?si=9cc467ccd3c24985ba489adf0c14989f&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing"target="_blank">
            Food halls at Virginia Tech</a> Which contains our thoughts on this topic.
